Welcome to my GitHub page. Since I need to keep order, I'm using GitHub
to collaborate with or send issues to other projects, both public and
private, and I host my own public projects at GitLab. That's where
the following links point to.

* [UEFI Flappy Bird Mirror](https://gitlab.com/llsant/flappy-bird-uefi-backup): A mirror of a bare-metal UEFI game that
works like Flappy Bird, along with some convenience virtual machine files.

* [MS-DOS viruses](https://gitlab.com/llsant/ms-dos-viruses): A pack of traditional MS-DOS viruses I found somewhere, for entertainment purposes on a virtual machine.
